What is the XOR Cipher?

- Heart of many modern ciphers
- Encrypts binary numbers
- Every key on keyboard has an ASCII code
- ASCII code is a combination of 8 binary digits
- Each ASCII code can be represented as a sequence of 8 binary digits (bits), for example:'A' -> ASCII 65 -> Binary 01000001

How XOR Encryption Works:
The XOR operation outputs 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same:

0 XOR 0 = 0  
1 XOR 0 = 1  
0 XOR 1 = 1  
1 XOR 1 = 0
To encrypt a message:

Convert each character to binary (ASCII)

XOR each bit with the corresponding bit of a key

The result is the ciphertext

To decrypt:

XOR the ciphertext with the same key again
XOR is reversible: (message XOR key) XOR key = message.
